## Plan

### Learning Objectives and Activities

This course will satisfy the current California State requirements for Computer Science lessons for the provided grades.

#### Computing Systems
##### Learning Objectives
###### - CS-01: Design modifications to computing devices to improve how users interact with the devices.
###### - CS-02: Design a project that combines hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.
###### - CS-03: Systematically apply troubleshooting strategies to identify and resolve hardware and software problems in computing systems.
##### Activity
###### - For example, students could create a design for the screen layout of a smartphone that is more usable by people with vision impairments or hand tremors. They might also design how to use the device as a scanner to convert text to speech.
###### - For example, students could design a mobile tour app that displays information relevant to specific locations when the device is nearby or when the user selects a virtual stop on tour. For their project design, they select appropriate components, such as GPS or cellular-based geolocation tools, textual input, and speech recognition.
###### - For example, students could work through a checklist of solutions for connectivity problems in a lab of computers connected wirelessly or through physical cables. They could also search for technical information online and engage in technical reading to create troubleshooting documents that they then apply.

#### Networks and the Internet
##### Learning Objectives
###### - NI-04: Model the role of protocols in transmitting data across networks and the Internet
###### - NI-05: Explain potential security threats and security measures to mitigate threats.
###### - NI-06: Apply multiple methods of information protection to model the secure transmission of information.
##### Activity
###### - For example, students could devise a plan for sending data representing a textual message and devise a plan for resending lost information
###### - For example, students could explain the importance of keeping passwords hidden, setting secure router administrator passwords, erasing a storage device before reusing it, and using firewalls to restrict access to private networks
###### - For example, students could identify methods of secret communication used during the Revolutionary War (e.g., ciphers, secret codes, invisible ink, hidden letters) and then secure their methods such as substitution ciphers or steganography (i.e., hiding messages inside a picture or other data) to compose a message from either the Continental Army or British Army.

#### Data and Analysis
##### Learning Objectives
###### - DA-07: Represent data in multiple ways
###### - DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful
###### - DA-09: Test and analyze the effects of changing variables while using computational models
##### Activity
###### - For example, students could use a color picker to explore the correspondence between the digital display or name of a color (high-level representations) and its RGB value or hex code (low-level representation).
###### - For example, students could use computational tools to collect data from their peers regarding the percentage of time technology is used for school work and entertainment and then create digital displays of their data and findings. Students could then transform the data to highlight relationships representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.
###### - For example, students could test a program that makes a robot move on a track by making changes to variables (e.g., height and angle of the track, size, and mass of the robot) and discussing how these changes affect how far the robot travels

#### Algorithms and Programming
##### Learning Objectives
###### - AP-10: Use flowcharts and/or pseudocode to design and illustrate algorithms that solve complex problems.
###### - AP-11: Create clearly named variables that store data and perform operations on their contents.
###### - AP-12: Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures and use compound conditions.
###### - AP-13: Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate programs' design, implementation, and review.
###### - AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.
###### - AP-15: Seek and incorporate feedback from team members and users to refine a solution that meets user needs.
###### - AP-16: Incorporate existing code, media, and libraries into original programs, and give attribution.
###### - AP-17: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases
###### - AP-18: Distribute tasks and maintain a project timeline when collaboratively developing computational artifacts.
###### - AP-19: Document programs to make them easier to use, read, test, and debug.
##### Activity
###### - For example, students might use a flowchart to illustrate an algorithm that produces a recommendation for purchasing sneakers based on inputs such as size, colors, brand, comfort, and cost.
###### - For example, students could program a quiz game with a score variable (e.g., quizScore) that is initially set to zero and increases by increments of one each time the user answers a quiz question correctly and decreases by increments of one each time a user answers a quiz question incorrectly, resulting in a score that is either a positive or negative integer
###### - For example, when programming an interactive story, students could only use a compound conditional within a loop to unlock a door if a character has a key AND is touching the door.
###### - Students could create an arcade game with a title screen, a game screen, and a win/lose screen with an option to play the game again. To do this, students need to identify subproblems that accompany each screen (e.g., selecting an avatar goes in the title screen, events for controlling character action and scoring go in the game screen, and displaying the final and high score and asking whether to play again goes in the win/lose screen)
###### - For example, students could create a procedure to draw a circle that involves many instructions, but others can invoke instruction, such as “drawCircle.” Students can quickly draw circles of different sizes by adding a radius parameter.
###### - For example, suppose students are designing an app to teach their classmates about recycling. In that case, they could first interview or survey their classmates to learn what their classmates already know about recycling and why they do or do not recycle. After building a prototype of the app, the students could test the app with a sample of their classmates to see if they learned anything from the app and if they had difficulty using the app (e.g., trouble reading or understanding text). After gathering interview data, students could refine the app to meet classmate's needs
###### - For example, when creating a side-scrolling game, students may incorporate portions of code that create a realistic jump movement from another person's game. They may also import Creative Commons-licensed images to use in the background.
###### - For example, students test programs by considering potential errors, such as what will happen if a user enters invalid input (e.g., negative numbers and 0 instead of positive numbers).
###### - For example, students could decompose the design stage into planning the storyboard, flowchart, and different parts of the game mechanics. They can then distribute tasks and roles among team members and assign deadlines.
###### - For example, students could add comments to describe the functionality of different code segments (e.g., input scores between 0 and 100, check for invalid input, calculate and display the average of the scores). They could also communicate the process of writing design documents, creating flowcharts, or making presentations.

#### Impacts of computing
##### Learning Objectives
###### - IC-20: Compare tradeoffs associated with computing technologies that affect people's everyday activities and career options.
###### - IC-21: Discuss issues of bias and accessibility in the design of existing technologies.
###### - IC-22: Collaborate with many contributors when creating a computational artifact.
###### - IC-23: Compare tradeoffs associated with licenses for computational artifacts to balance the protection of the creators' rights and the ability for others to use and modify the artifacts.
###### - IC-23: Compare tradeoffs between allowing information to be public and keeping information private and secure.
##### Activity
###### - For example, students could compare and contrast the impacts of computing technologies with the impacts of other systems developed throughout history, such as the Pony Express and the US Postal System.
###### - For example, students could discuss the impacts of facial recognition software that works better for lighter skin tones and recognize that engineers developed the software with a homogeneous testing group. Students could then discuss how accessibility could be improved by sampling a more diverse population.
###### - For example, students could use electronic surveys to solicit input from their neighborhood regarding a critical social or political issue. They could collaborate with a community artist to combine animations and create a digital community college informing the public about various points of view regarding the topic.
###### - For example, students could create interactive animations to educate others on bullying or protecting the environment. They then select an appropriate license to reflect how they want their program used by others (e.g., allow others to use their work and alter it, as long as they do not profit from it). Students use established methods to both protect their artifacts and attribute the use of protected artifacts
###### - For example, students could discuss the benefits of artists and designers displaying their work online to reach a broader audience. Students could also compare the tradeoffs of making a shared file accessible to anyone versus restricting it to specific accounts.
