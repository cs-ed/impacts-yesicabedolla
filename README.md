# Impacts on Society

The Computer Science program offered by Sunnyside Union Elementary School in Tulare County targets the interest of its 6th through 8th-grade students. The field of computer science is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing career fields in the country. This elective program will introduce its students to the basic concepts of computer programing and computer science to elicit interest in this field. Students with no knowledge of computer science will quickly learn the ins and outs of the program and prepare them for further advancements. Socioeconomically disadvantaged students make up the majority of Tulare county, and this course will give the students a new career field they can strive to enter.

The Computer Science program will expand on the understandings and skills students will develop through the course. This program will also help the students build a safe and welcoming computing culture for all, especially those not well represented in the computer science field. 

Students can expect to learn different computational concepts while enrolled in this course. These concepts will carry with them if they choose to continue in this field:
- Developing algorithms and programs
- Designing computational solutions
- Development of abstraction in programs
- Analyzing computing code
- Understanding the responsibilities that come with computing
- Innovations of computing through the years

Students attending this program can expect to learn various concepts that can significantly increase their knowledge of computer science, such as:
- Developing personal creativity while completing projects
- Using specific algorithms and programing language to create informative pages
- Learn the terminology of computer systems and networking. 
- Understand the impact computing has on society


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

- Students will remember and identify the protocols in transmitting data across the internet
- Students will understand and predict the effects of changing variables while using computational models
- Students will apply and use techniques learned to design a project that combines hardware and software components to collect and exchange data
- Students will analyze and integrate knowledge to decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate programs' design, implementation, and review
- Evaluate tradeoffs associated with computing technologies that affect people's everyday activities and career options

### Outcomes

The outcomes describe the core competencies expected of all Computer Science graduates from SDSM&T. The program's focus is on preparing graduates for software development careers that emphasize mathematical, scientific, and engineering applications. The program also prepares students for their careers by emphasizing communication, teamwork, and ethics and examining the local, global, and societal impacts of innovation and technological advancement. At the time of graduation, all students will: 
- Possess a strong foundation in the software development process
- Be able to solve problems using a variety of programming languages and have extensive experience with at least one high-level language
- Have a background in computer hardware and experience with a variety of operating systems
- Possess an extensive background in mathematics and an appreciation of the scientific method 
- Have an understanding of the theoretical foundations of computing
- Have developed practical communication skills and have experience working with teams; 
- Possess an understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities.

### Assessment

Assessing the students' competency will consist of a knowledge examination at the end of each section. The purpose of these separate exams is to test each student's knowledge as they learn and reduce the test anxiety for multiple subjects at the end of the course. Folowing the lesson will be a practical application portion comprised of five different activities which will cover the learning objectives and societal implications.

#### Activity 1
Cyber-attacks have become commonplace in the recent years and because of this, students should understand and understand what goes into keeping sensitive information safe. Students will work in groups to develop a plan for sending data represented as a sensitive file from one company to another. The groups will establish a network using key components learned in their lessons to make a safe network. In this activity, students will explain the importance of keeping passwords hidden, setting secure router administrator passwords, erasing a storage device before reusing it, and using firewalls to restrict access to private networks. The students will also develop a plan to interpret the file data if their network becomes a victim of a cyber-attack. 

#### Activity 2
With the world turning to autonomous vehicles and robotic solutions to complete certain tasks previously done by humans. Warehouses like those used by Amazon utilize a network of robots to pick items to speed up delivery to their customers. Companies like Uber and Lyft have invested money into the new technology needed to make autonomous travel a success. The use of this technology takes some jobs away but opens the doors to new outlooks on how robotics can help society. In this activity, students will work in groups to test a program that makes a warehouse robot or autonomous vehicle move on a track by making changes to variables. The students will alter variables to accomplish different tasks like picking items from warehouse shelves or taking people to and from locations. 

#### Activity 3
Well before the water issues in Flint Michigan, the safety of drinking water has been on the mind of consumers and government officials alike. The use of technology aimed at collecting data on safe water composition is important for our future. In this activity, students will design a project that uses a sensor to collect the mineral content, toxicity levels and purity of drinking water. They may select a sensor that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection because it supports greater mobility, or they could instead select a physical USB connection that does not require a separate power source.

#### Activity 4
One part of the education system that has historically taken the most time is grading both assignments and overall classroom participation. With the assistance of technology, this portion of the education system can be automated allowing the teacher to focus on providing instruction to students in need. In this activity, students will decompose the problem of calculating and displaying class grades. Subproblems might include: accept input for students grades on various assignments, check for invalid grade entries, calculate per assignment averages, calculate per student averages, and display histograms of student scores for each assignment.

#### Activity 5
With the emergence of autonomous vehicles and hacking networks, the risk of a vehicle network being hacked is a real issue. Our society is leaning towards an autonomous vehicle future to mitigate risks and issues caused by human errors and thinking and preparing can be helpful. In this activity, students will identify tradeoffs for both personal and professional uses of a driverless cars who can increase convenience and reduce accidents, but they may be susceptible to hacking. The emerging industry will reduce the number of taxi and shared-ride drivers, but may create more software engineering and cybersecurity jobs

### Activity Outcomes

- Students will explain the importance of keeping passwords hidden, setting secure router administrator passwords, erasing a storage device before reusing it, and using firewalls to restrict access to private networks
- Students will test a program that makes a robot move on a track by making changes to variables (e.g., height and angle of the track, size, and mass of the robot) and discussing how these changes affect how far the robot travels
- Students will create an arcade game with a title screen, a game screen, and a win/lose screen with an option to play the game again. To do this, students need to identify subproblems that accompany each screen (e.g., selecting an avatar goes in the title screen, events for controlling character action and scoring go in the game screen, and displaying the final and high score and asking whether to play again goes in the win/lose screen)
- Students will compare and contrast the impacts of computing technologies with the impacts of other systems developed throughout history, such as the Pony Express and the US Postal System
