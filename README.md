# Impacts on Society

The Computer Science program offered by Sunnyside Union Elementary School in Tulare County targets the interest of its 6th through 8th-grade students. The field of computer science is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing career fields in the country. This elective program will introduce its students to the basic concepts of computer programing and computer science to elicit interest in this field. Students with no knowledge of computer science will quickly learn the ins and outs of the program and prepare them for further advancements. Socioeconomically disadvantaged students make up the majority of Tulare county, and this course will give the students a new career field they can strive to enter.

The Computer Science program will expand on the understandings and skills students will develop through the course. This program will also help the students build a safe and welcoming computing culture for all, especially those not well represented in the computer science field. 

Students can expect to learn different computational concepts while enrolled in this course. These concepts will carry with them if they choose to continue in this field:
- Developing algorithms and programs
- Designing computational solutions
- Development of abstraction in programs
- Analyzing computing code
- Understanding the responsibilities that come with computing
- Innovations of computing through the years

Students attending this program can expect to learn various concepts that can significantly increase their knowledge of computer science, such as:
- Developing personal creativity while completing projects
- Using specific algorithms and programing language to create informative pages
- Learn the terminology of computer systems and networking. 
- Understand the impact computing has on society


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

- Design a project that combines hardware and software components to collect and exchange data
- Model the role of protocols in transmitting data across networks and the Internet
- Test and analyze the effects of changing variables while using computational models
- Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate programs' design, implementation, and review
- Compare tradeoffs associated with computing technologies that affect people's everyday activities and career options

### Activity

- Students will explain the importance of keeping passwords hidden, setting secure router administrator passwords, erasing a storage device before reusing it, and using firewalls to restrict access to private networks
- Students will test a program that makes a robot move on a track by making changes to variables (e.g., height and angle of the track, size, and mass of the robot) and discussing how these changes affect how far the robot travels
- Students will create an arcade game with a title screen, a game screen, and a win/lose screen with an option to play the game again. To do this, students need to identify subproblems that accompany each screen (e.g., selecting an avatar goes in the title screen, events for controlling character action and scoring go in the game screen, and displaying the final and high score and asking whether to play again goes in the win/lose screen)
- Students will compare and contrast the impacts of computing technologies with the impacts of other systems developed throughout history, such as the Pony Express and the US Postal System

### Assessment

Assessing the students' competency will consist of a knowledge examination at the end of each section. The purpose of these separate exams is to test each student's knowledge as they learn and reduce the test anxiety for multiple subjects at the end of the course.

### Outcomes

The outcomes describe the core competencies expected of all Computer Science graduates from SDSM&T. The program's focus is on preparing graduates for software development careers that emphasize mathematical, scientific, and engineering applications. The program also prepares students for their careers by emphasizing communication, teamwork, and ethics and examining the local, global, and societal impacts of innovation and technological advancement. At the time of graduation, all students will: 
- Possess a strong foundation in the software development process
- Be able to solve problems using a variety of programming languages and have extensive experience with at least one high-level language
- Have a background in computer hardware and experience with a variety of operating systems
- Possess an extensive background in mathematics and an appreciation of the scientific method 
- Have an understanding of the theoretical foundations of computing
- Have developed practical communication skills and have experience working with teams; 
- Possess an understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities.
